   - Created helper functions in `session-helpers.js` to normalize data
   - Improved error handling for missing or malformed session data

3. **Results & Sessions Tab Data Issues**
   - Enhanced the `/getResults` endpoint to reliably return session data
   - Added fallback mechanism when file reading fails
   - Improved data format compatibility across different session structures

4. **File Access Issues**
   - Added robust error handling for file system operations
   - Implemented backup data provision when file access fails
   - Enhanced logging to better identify file access issues

5. **User Session Visibility**
   - Fixed issues with admin1 sessions not being displayed
   - Updated endpoint to ensure data for all users is returned
   - Added test data generation for empty user sessions

## New Features Added

1. **Debugging Tools**
   - Created API Test Page (`api-test.html`) for easy endpoint testing
   - Added test script (`test-save-results.js`) to verify data storage functionality
   - Created comprehensive debugging documentation (`DEBUG.md`)

2. **Enhanced Endpoints**
   - Added filtering and pagination to the `/getResults` endpoint
   - Enhanced `/saveResults` endpoint with improved error handling
   - Added logging to track data flow through the application

3. **UI Improvements**
   - Enhanced session display with fallbacks for different data formats
   - Improved error handling in session rendering

## Recommendations for Future Improvements

1. **Data Consistency**
   - Standardize session data format across all parts of the application
   - Add data migration utilities for older format sessions

2. **Error Recovery**
   - Implement automatic backups of data files
   - Add periodic data integrity checks

3. **Performance**
   - Consider pagination for large result sets in the UI
   - Add caching for frequently accessed data

4. **Security**
   - Add input validation to all endpoints
   - Implement authentication for API endpoints

## Testing Instructions

1. **Session Data Testing**
   - Use the API test page at http://localhost:3000/api-test.html
   - Create new test sessions with varying parameters
   - Verify sessions appear in both the test page and main application

2. **Data Persistence Testing**
   - Run the test script: `node test-save-results.js`
   - Verify data is properly stored and can be retrieved
   - Check that new users automatically get initialized in all data files

## Conclusion

The application now handles session data more robustly, with improved error handling and fallback mechanisms when file access issues occur. The UI components have been updated to handle different data formats, ensuring a consistent user experience regardless of how the data is stored. New debugging tools make it easier to identify and fix issues in the future.
